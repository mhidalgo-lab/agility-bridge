## Open decisions

### D-89 — The activity stream is not read by the history tools *(P6-05)*
- **Context:** ADR-0011 and L-146 say the activity stream is "only a hint": it may not contain every change. It is also
  outside the live-test guard (only `rest-1.v1` `Data` and `Hist`, `meta.v1` and `query.v1` are allowed), so any code
  against it would ship unverified, and RESEARCH records it as never probed.
- **Options:** (a) do not read it; `get_asset_history` and `list_recent_changes` use `Hist` and `query.v1` only and say
  their source; (b) add an optional, clearly labelled `activity_hint` section later, after the endpoint is probed on the
  writable sandbox; (c) read it now, unverified.
- **Recommendation:** (a), built. (b) is task [P6-21](../tasks/phase-6-tool-breadth/P6-21-history-sandbox-verification.md),
  after the sandbox exists.
- **Owner:** pending.

### D-90 — `get_asset_history` is not paged; its window and row cap are the bound *(P6-05)*
- **Context:** `rest-1.v1/Hist/<type>/<id>` answers every version of the asset in one response; it cannot be narrowed by
  date on the request (not verified whether it accepts a `where` on `ChangeDate`, see RESEARCH §1.4). The tool therefore
  fetches once (response bytes are capped by the client), diffs, applies the window and returns at most `limit` rows
  (default: the workspace page size), newest first, with `truncated` when more exist. `time_range` defaults to the last
  30 days and may not exceed `maxTimeRangeDays`; `list_recent_changes` defaults to 7 days.
- **Options:** (a) as built: one request, row cap, no cursor; (b) a cursor over the diff rows (a second call repeats the
  whole `Hist` request, so it costs the same again for each page); (c) refuse assets with more than N versions.
- **Recommendation:** (a). A person asks about a window, not for page 7 of a version list; a window and a field list
  narrow the answer, and (b) adds a request per page for no new information.
- **Owner:** pending.

### D-91 — `list_recent_changes` covers the four work-item types, not portfolio items *(P6-05)*
- **Context:** the tool queries Story, Defect, Task and Test through the same filters and merge as `search_work_items`
  (one batched `query.v1`, per-type cursors). Epics and other portfolio items live under their own scope strategy and
  belong with the portfolio tools ([P6-01](../tasks/phase-6-tool-breadth/P6-01-tools-portfolio.md)). `get_asset_history`
  works on any readable asset type, epics included.
- **Options:** (a) four work-item types now; portfolio items later; (b) add `Epic` now.
- **Recommendation:** (a), with [P6-22](../tasks/phase-6-tool-breadth/P6-22-recent-changes-portfolio-items.md) adding epics
  once P6-01 settles how portfolio items are listed.
- **Owner:** pending.
